This type of braces is placed on the inner side of the teeth, making them less visible. Due to the moderate complexity of your case, you'll have in-clinic visits for monitoring to ensure everything progresses smoothly. Extensive attachments will be utilized to assist with the necessary tooth movements. Additionally, whitening is included as part of your treatment plan to enhance your smile."
