    "summary": "Your treatment plan involves using clear aligners to adjust the alignment of your upper teeth. This is considered a straightforward case, and it's expected to take about 4–6 months to complete. Most of the progress will be monitored remotely, which means fewer in-office visits. To help achieve the desired movement, we'll be using attachments on your teeth. While whitening is not included in this package, the focus is on ensuring a smooth and effective alignment process with clear aligners.",
