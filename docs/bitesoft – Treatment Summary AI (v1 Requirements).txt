bitesoft – Treatment Summary AI (v1 Requirements)
________________


1. Purpose of the Feature
What this feature is
The Treatment Summary AI generates a clear, patient-friendly explanation of an aligner treatment plan using structured inputs that are provided or approved by the dentist.
It is designed to support patient communication and internal documentation within the provider portal.
What this feature is NOT
* It does not diagnose

* It does not decide treatment

* It does not generate staging or clinical plans

* It does not guarantee outcomes

* It does not infer details beyond the provided inputs

* It does not provide pricing or financial information

The dentist remains the clinical decision-maker at all times.

2. Example Treatment Summaries
(Illustrative examples of tone, structure, and quality — based only on supplied inputs)
________________


Example 1 — Patient | Reassuring
Based on your assessment, this is a mild alignment case that can be treated using clear aligners across both the upper and lower teeth.
Treatment is expected to take approximately 4–6 months, with most progress monitored remotely to reduce the need for frequent in-office visits.
This type of treatment is generally smooth and predictable, and we’ll guide you through each stage to ensure things stay on track.
This treatment also includes whitening as part of your overall smile plan.
________________


Example 2 — Patient | Concise
This treatment uses clear aligners to straighten both upper and lower teeth.
Estimated treatment time is 4–6 months, with progress primarily monitored remotely.
Whitening is included as part of your treatment package.
________________


Example 3 — Patient | Casual
We’ll be using clear aligners to gently straighten your teeth over about 4–6 months.
Most of your progress will be checked remotely, with in-clinic visits only if needed.
Whitening is included as part of your overall treatment.
________________


Example 4 — Patient | Informative (Moderate case)
This treatment focuses on improving alignment using clear aligners.
Treatment is expected to take around 6–9 months and will involve a combination of remote monitoring and occasional in-clinic reviews.
Attachments may be used to help guide certain tooth movements throughout treatment.
Whitening may be included as part of your treatment plan, depending on your practice’s offering.
________________


Example 5 — Internal | Clinical (Dentist / Staff)
Moderate aligner case involving both arches. Estimated duration 6–9 months. Mixed monitoring approach planned with attachments required. Whitening included.

                     * Area treated (upper / lower / both)

                     * Estimated duration (range)

                     * Case difficulty (simple / moderate / complex – high-level only)

                     * Monitoring approach (remote / mixed / in-clinic)

                     * Attachments (none / some / extensive)

                     * Whitening included (true / false)
