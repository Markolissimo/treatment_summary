sharing a starter Tier → CDT mapping so you can lay out the database/priority logic. Please treat this as an architecture scaffold, not final billing guidance (final codes will always be selected/approved and edited by the treating dentist and can vary by payer/state).
1) Our working tiers (US)
We’re planning to bucket cases into:
* Express / Mild (limited aligner treatment)
* Moderate
* Complex (comprehensive orthodontic treatment)
We’ll also pass a simple flag for age group (adolescent vs adult) because CDT codes differ there.
2) Starter Tier → CDT mapping (primary ortho code)
Our Tier
	Typical Ortho CDT Code (Adolescent)
	Typical Ortho CDT Code (Adult)
	Notes
	Express / Mild (limited)
	D8010 (Limited orthodontic treatment)
	D8010 (Limited orthodontic treatment)
	Use for minor alignment / short duration
	Moderate (comprehensive)
	D8080 (Comprehensive orthodontic treatment – adolescent dentition)
	D8090 (Comprehensive orthodontic treatment – adult dentition)
	Default “comprehensive” tier
	Complex (comprehensive)
	D8080
	D8090
	Same primary code as Moderate; complexity reflected in fee/notes, not necessarily a different CDT
	Priority logic (simple):
1. If Tier = Express/Mild → D8010
2. If Tier = Moderate/Complex → choose D8080 vs D8090 based on age_group
3) Common add-on / supporting documentation codes (optional)
These are not always needed, but are commonly used for insurance documentation / claim support:
Records / diagnostics (examples):
* D0330 panoramic radiograph
* D0210 intraoral complete series of radiographic images (FMX)
* D0350 oral/facial photographic images
* D0470 diagnostic casts (if applicable)
Retention (if billed separately):
* D8680 orthodontic retention (completion of active treatment)
4) Explicit exclusions / notes for v1 architecture
* Whitening: typically not covered / not part of ortho CDT claim logic (we’ll keep separate)
* Monitoring/DM: generally not a CDT code; can be described in narrative if needed
* This mapping is for claim-support / superbill generation and explanation text, not automatic billing.
5) Data fields we’ll pass to support the rules
* tier (Express/Mild/Moderate/Complex)
* age_group (adolescent/adult)
* Optional: diagnostic_assets flags (photos/xray/fmx/casts available)
* Optional: retainers_included (true/false)
If this structure works for you, you can model CDT logic as:
* a primary ortho code selection rule (tier + age_group)
* optional add-on codes toggled by diagnostic assets / retention
We can tighten/expand the mapping once we move into the insurance module scope, but this should be enough for you to design the core schema and rule engine now.
